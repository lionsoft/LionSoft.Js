Implementation of the `String.cs`.\r\n * Sync'd row position across orientation changes.\r\n * _To be continue..._\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\n    No dependencies.\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n\r\nTwo setup options are available:\r\n 1. Install from `NuGet` or\r\n 2. [Download the latest release](https://github.com/lionsoft/LionSoft.Js/archive/master.zip) from GitHub.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nAs soon as you've got all the files downloaded you just need to include the only file `LionSoft.Js-{version}.js` on your page or `BundleConfig.RegisterBundles`. All others files of the library will be loaded automatically.\r\n\r\nAll the details you can read on the project documentation site.\r\n\r\n*Please see the `/sample` app for a more detailed code example of how to use the library.*\r\n\r\n## Authors\r\n\r\n**LionSoft**\r\n\r\n- <http://github.com/lionsoft>\r\n- <https://www.codeplex.com/site/users/view/lionsoft>\r\n\r\n\r\n## Copyright and license\r\n\r\nCopyright 2013 LionSoft under [the MIT license](LICENSE).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
