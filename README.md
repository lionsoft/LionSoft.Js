# LionSoft.Js


This is a custom library of the javascript extensions.

The `LionSoft.Js` implements standard `.NET` library methods and even more.

Actually I know that it is _'yet another bicycle'_ but it helps me (and I hope someone else) learn JS.

Some single functions were borrowed from Intenet with saving their copyrights.

The most of the code is based on `TypeScript` sources with their `JavaScript` analogs.

Recommended for using in `VisualStudio` (otherwise you don't need this library).

## Features

 * Dynamic loading scripts by two methods (sync and async).
 * Standard methods for working with strings. Implementation of the `String.cs`.
 * Sync'd row position across orientation changes.
 * _To be continue..._

## Dependencies

    No dependencies.

## Setup

Two setup options are available:
 1. Install from `NuGet` or
 2. [Download the latest release](https://github.com/lionsoft/LionSoft.Js/archive/master.zip) from GitHub.

## Usage

As soon as you've got all the files downloaded you just need to include the only file `LionSoft.Js-{version}.js` on your page or `BundleConfig.RegisterBundles`. All others files of the library will be loaded automatically.

All the details you can read on the project documentation site.

*Please see the `/sample` app for a more detailed code example of how to use the library.*
